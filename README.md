# linkat: a-meow-zingly short urls
linkat is a link shortener service that shows a cat gif for 5 seconds before redirecting the user to the final url. It's inspired by services like **ad.fly**, but with cats instead of ads.

# linkat-app
linkat-app is the front-end for linkat. It runs on Angular. The production url for this api is https://linkat.fun.
